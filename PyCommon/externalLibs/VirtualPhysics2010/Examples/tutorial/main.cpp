VirtualPhysics v0.9

VirtualPhysics was developed as part of the project entitled "Development of 
Real-time Physics Simulation Engine for e-Entertainments" which was financially
supported by the grant from the strategic technology development program
(Project No. 2008-F-033-02) of both the MKE(Ministry of Knowledge Economy) and
MCST(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism) of Korea.
